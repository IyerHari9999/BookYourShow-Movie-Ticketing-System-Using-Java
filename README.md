INTRODUCTION 
The program BookYourShow is a Graphical User Interface based program that stimulates a real-time movie booking System interface to the end User. 

WHY THIS PROJECT 
This project provided us an  opportunity to implement various Object Oriented Concepts learned throughout the course of Introduction to Object Oriented Programming Methodology. 
Also, a graphical based interface is how an end user would like to interact with a program. 
This project allowed us to demonstrate how a real-world application on Booking System would work. 

ADT SPECIFICATIONS 
This GUI Based Project helps an end user to book Movie tickets.  
The user selects options like language, movie, show time, date, Theater and the seats. 
Finally, there is a backend calculation happening on the basis of the above factors selected by the user, which finally helps in displaying the details and the final amount.
